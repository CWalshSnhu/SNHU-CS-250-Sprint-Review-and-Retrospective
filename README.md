1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Undestanding user needs is vital for developing software for a client. It is the key to understanding exactly what the client wants. User stories are created to help make the client's needs clearer by identifying goals and issues to overcome. User stories are usually formatted as: “As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit].”

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

For developing programs, the best approach for implementing a SDLC framework is to identify what methodology will best suit your project. If you are a single developer, Agile wouldn't make much sense, since you are not in a team enviorment. In fact, the Big Bang methodology might even suit you. If you are working on a program that has very little end user interaction with very little changes, such as factory machinery, then a style like Waterfall might make more sense. However, for the brunt of most software projects, Agile processes are highly effective for continuously changing software or high end-user interaction. For me, I beleive the Scrum framework could very well be effective in my future video game projects. Right now, agile dosen't make sense for me since I'm a single developer. However, working in a small team for a development company, or even my own Indie game company, agile could very well be used to release video games due to it's highly changing nature and it's major end-user client base. 

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member, even in any company, requires hard-working and kind people that go above and beyond for other teammates. They treat others with respect, kindness and dignity, and work hard to follow the company's software practices. They also focus to develop their best work, and make sure to document their code for their other team members to understand. Overall, their best intrest is for their team, the client, and for the software being developed.
